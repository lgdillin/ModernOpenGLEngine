Vectors, Matrices, and Uniform Variables in OpenGL

== Vector Overview
	- A quantity with magnitude and direction
	- Can be used for lots of things, normally to represent a direction,
	or something's position (eg. how far and in what direction 
	something is, relative to a certain point)
	
	Cool vector identity:
	dot(v1, v2) = magnitude(v1) * magnitude(v1) * cos(theta)
	magnitude(v1) = sqrt(v1.x**2 + v1.y**2 + v1.z**2)

Yes, it is possible to scale and clip a texture dynamically when 
transforming primitives in OpenGL. You can achieve this by modifying 
the texture coordinates used to sample the texture in the fragment 
shader.

To scale a texture, you can apply a scaling transformation to the 
texture coordinates. This can be done by multiplying the texture 
coordinates by a scaling factor. For example, if you want to scale 
the texture coordinates by a factor of 2 in the x-axis and 1.5 in 
the y-axis, you would multiply the texture coordinates by vec2(2.0, 1.5).

To clip a texture, you can modify the texture coordinates to only 
sample a specific portion of the texture. 
This can be done by specifying the desired texture coordinate range. 
For example, if you want to clip the texture to only sample the 
top-left quadrant, you would modify the texture coordinates to be 
in the range of (0, 0) to (0.5, 0.5).

You can perform these transformations in the vertex shader or pass 
the scaling and clipping parameters to the fragment shader as uniforms 
and perform the transformations in the fragment shader. 
By manipulating the texture coordinates in this way, you can 
dynamically control the scaling and clipping of the texture to 
achieve the desired effect on the transformed primitives.



Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates scaling and clipping 
a texture dynamically using a vertex shader and a fragment shader:

Vertex Shader:
```glsl
#version 330 core

layout(location = 0) in vec3 position;
layout(location = 1) in vec2 texCoord;

uniform mat4 modelMatrix;
uniform mat4 viewMatrix;
uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;
uniform vec2 scale;
uniform vec2 clipMin;
uniform vec2 clipMax;

out vec2 fragTexCoord;

void main()
{
    // Apply scaling transformation to texture coordinates
    vec2 scaledTexCoord = texCoord * scale;

    // Apply clipping to texture coordinates
    vec2 clippedTexCoord = clamp(scaledTexCoord, clipMin, clipMax);

    // Pass the transformed texture coordinates to the fragment shader
    fragTexCoord = clippedTexCoord;

    // Perform the standard vertex transformations
    vec4 transformedPos = modelMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * viewMatrix * transformedPos;
}
```

Fragment Shader:
```glsl
#version 330 core

in vec2 fragTexCoord;
out vec4 fragColor;

uniform sampler2D textureSampler;

void main()
{
    // Sample the texture using the transformed texture coordinates
    fragColor = texture(textureSampler, fragTexCoord);
}
```

In your C++ code, you would set the scale, clipMin, and clipMax uniforms 
to control the scaling and clipping behavior. Make sure to properly bind
and activate the shader program, set the uniform values, and bind 
the appropriate texture before drawing your primitives.

Note that this is just a basic example to demonstrate the concept. 
You may need to adapt and customize the code to fit your specific 
requirements and rendering pipeline.

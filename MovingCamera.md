When applying matrix transformations to a camera in OpenGL, 
it is generally easier to use a `vec3` for representing the camera's position. 
The reason is that camera transformations typically involve translation, rotation, 
and scaling operations, which can be achieved using a 4x4 transformation matrix.

A `vec3` (3D vector) representing the camera position can be easily used with 
transformation matrices by extending it to a 4D vector with a homogeneous 
coordinate of 1. This is known as homogeneous representation. 

By appending a 1 as the fourth component of the `vec3`, you can multiply it 
with a 4x4 matrix to perform translations.

For example, let's say you have a translation matrix `translationMatrix` 
and a camera position represented as `glm::vec3 cameraPosition`. 
You can apply the translation to the camera position as follows:

```cpp
glm::vec4 cameraPositionHomogeneous(cameraPosition, 1.0f);
glm::vec4 transformedPosition = translationMatrix * cameraPositionHomogeneous;
glm::vec3 transformedCameraPosition = glm::vec3(transformedPosition);
```

In this code, `cameraPositionHomogeneous` is a `vec4` representation 
of the camera position with the homogeneous coordinate set to 1. 
The translation matrix `translationMatrix` is multiplied with 
the `cameraPositionHomogeneous` vector to apply the translation. 
Finally, the resulting `vec4` is converted back to a `vec3` using 
the constructor of `glm::vec3` to obtain the transformed camera position.

Using a `vec3` for camera positions simplifies the code and calculations, 
as you don't need to handle the additional complexity introduced by a `vec4`.
However, keep in mind that when working with other transformations or 
calculations, such as perspective projection, you may need to use a 4D vector 
or a 4x4 matrix to correctly represent and manipulate the camera's properties.

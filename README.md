# ModernOpenGLEngine
Creation of a modern interactive Engine with OpenGL and SDL

# What this is
This is a documentation of my learning experience of developing a rendering engine, 
and learning the techniques associated with computer graphics.

My plans for the future of this project are to flesh out the graphics component to a satisfactory degree (I currently
believe that after implementing deferred shading I will be satisfied), I will being to implement a physics simulation
component to the engine. In the future I would like to translate this project from OpenGL to Vulkan, to make use of the
cutting edge ray-tracing technology being used, so I don't want to overburden myself with the translation from OpenGL to
Vulkan by implementing too many features.  The physics however should easily transfer with little trouble. 

At the very least, I would like this engine to be comparable to the Havok physics engine 
(used in half-life 2, painkiller, and others). If I can achieve that then I'll take some time to make a (hopefully)
interesting physics-focused game out of it.
